# INTERNET SPEED TESTER USING PYTHON
  Internet Speed Tester is an application that measures internet quality or speed for the connected device. It is used by us when we face any internet issue or when we want to check the bandwidth of the internet.  We will be using the speedtest module to find out the internet speed. Here, we measure the following speeds:
1. Download Speed
2. Upload Speed

# Tools/Technologies used:
1. Python - Pycharm
2. GUI - Tkinter module
3. speedtest-cli module

# Prerequisites:
Prior knowledge of Python and the Tkinter module would help the developer while building the project. You can download the necessary modules using the following commands:
1. pip install tk
2. pip install speedtest-cli

# Steps:
1. First, we import the required modules
2. Then, write a function to calculate the download and upload speed
3. Create a window using GUI tkinter module
4. Write functions for the buttons in the GUI window.

# Output:
